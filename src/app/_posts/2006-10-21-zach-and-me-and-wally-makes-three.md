Still in Cairns today and things are still great. Despite our mothers, fiance (mine), girlfriend (Zach's) having misgiving, we survived two dives at the Great Ocean Reef with Down Under Dives. The Reef is INCREDIBLE...so beautiful. We saw a giant turtle (actually Zach and I managed a photo with it), numerous fish and coral, stingray, and Wally. Wally is the diving company's mascot of sorts -- he is by far the biggest fish I have ever seen, maybe upwards of 150 pounds (photos to come from our underwater camera). For those interested in seeing my handsome face underwater, the diving company photographer took a great photo of me with some coral and a clown fish or two (also to be posted later).  
  
After our dives, we returned to shore for much needed dinner (for Kim - at Splash, a great seafood place down the street from the hotel) and have now returned to the internet cafe before gelato. Tomorrow, we will be returning to the Reef for two more dives at a location south of our dives today. We will then be moving to a hotel in Palm Cove, north of Cairns for two nights before moving onto Sydney.  
  
That's all for now (almost gelato time). Will post again in the coming days.
