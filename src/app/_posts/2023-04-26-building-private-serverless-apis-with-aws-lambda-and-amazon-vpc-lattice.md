title: "Building private serverless APIs with AWS Lambda and Amazon VPC Lattice"
author: "Josh"
summary: "Amazon VPC Lattice is a new, generally available application networking service that simplifies connectivity between services. Builders can connect, secure, and monitor services on instances, containers, or serverless compute in a simplified and consistent manner. VPC Lattice supports AWS Lambda functions as both a target and a consumer of services. This blog post explores how to incorporate VPC Lattice into your serverless workloads to simplify private access to HTTP-based APIs built with Lambda."
