title: "Amazon ElastiCache: Utilizing Redis Geospatial Capabilities"
author: "Josh"
summary: "Amazon ElastiCache makes it easy to deploy and manage a highly available and scalable in-memory data store in the cloud. Among the open source in-memory engines available to you for use with ElastiCache is Redis, which added powerful geospatial capabilities in version 3.2. This post explores using these capabilities to build an app that locates nearby bike share stations in Chicago. You can easily extend the app to other cities or to use other geo datasets."
