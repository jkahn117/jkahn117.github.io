This post is something of a departure from my normal ramblings, but I didn't want the release of Yahoo's News Digest app to pass without note.  In a world of never-ending news feeds and infinite scrolling, returning to a fully consumable, information experience has been a joy over the past 24 hours.

News Digest delivers two daily digest, each with eight articles on the topics of the day -- this morning focused on Chris Christie and Dennis Rodman.  The articles are short (more on that momentarily), reasonably informational, and contain links to other sources.  It's a nice approach to mobile news in our increasingly attention-strained world.

As much as I've enjoyed News Digest in its first day of release, I do have a few quibbles:

1.  The articles are almost to short.  Most of the stories thus far leave me wanting for more.
2.  Proofread, please.  I've already noted a couple of simple grammatical errors that should be caught in such a short format.
