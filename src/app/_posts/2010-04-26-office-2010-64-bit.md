Been a long time since I have posted to this blog and honestly, this post if a bit off topic, but I think helpful.

We use Outlook at work and being the technologist that I am, I upgraded to the Office 2010 RTM last week -- 64-bit of course. This morning I noticed that neither my Outlook conferencing add-in was working nor was Communicator storing conversation history. Â After some digging, I found the following:

Office 2010 Conferencing Add-in -- January 2010 Add-in (support for 64-bit):

[http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/help/HA102368901033.aspx](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/help/HA102368901033.aspx)

Office Communicator 2007 R2 Update -- January 2010:

[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976135/](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976135/)

\*\*If you work where I do, you can just install these updates over the top of what you had previously installed and still retain existing settings.
