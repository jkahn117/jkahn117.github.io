title: "Integrating alternative data sources with AWS AppSync: Amazon Neptune and Amazon ElastiCache"
author: "Josh"
summary: "In this post, we explore how AWS AppSync can utilize AWS Lambda to integrate with alternative data sourcesâ€”in other words, those not directly integrated out-of-the-box with AWS AppSync. While we look specifically at Amazon ElastiCache and Amazon Neptune here, you could support other data sources via a similar approach (including forthcoming services such as Amazon QLDB and Amazon Timestream)."
