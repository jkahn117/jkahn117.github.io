I've been doing some research on AJAX best practices of late and found a few links worth sharing / archiving:

*   [Best Practices for Speeding Up Your Web Site](http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html) ([presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/stoyan/high-performance-web-pages-20-new-best-practices?src=embed))
*   [YSlow](http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/): Firefox extension from Yahoo for evaluating site performance with Firebug
*   [YUI Compressor](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/): Compressor for CSS, JavaScript

Yes, all are from Yahoo, but all seem to be useful, especially the tooling.
