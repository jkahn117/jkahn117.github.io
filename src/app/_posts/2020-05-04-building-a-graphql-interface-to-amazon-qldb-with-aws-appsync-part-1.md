title: "Building a GraphQL interface to Amazon QLDB with AWS AppSync: Part 1"
author: "Josh"
summary: "Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (QLDB) is a purpose-built database for use cases that require an authoritative data source. Amazon QLDB maintains a complete, immutable history of all changes committed to the database (referred to as a ledger). Amazon QLDB fits well in finance, eCommerce, inventory, government, and numerous other applications. Pairing Amazon QLDB with services such as AWS AppSync allows you to safely expose data and that dataâ€™s history for mobile applications, websites, or a data lake. This post explores a reusable approach for integrating Amazon QLDB with AWS AppSync to power an example government use case."
