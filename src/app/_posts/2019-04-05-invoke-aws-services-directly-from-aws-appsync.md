title: "Invoke AWS services directly from AWS AppSync"
author: "Josh"
summary: "AWS AppSync is a managed GraphQL service that enables developers to easily build data-driven mobile and web applications. Using a serverless backend, you can build a GraphQL API by connecting AWS AppSync to various data sourcesâ€”including Amazon DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, and Amazon OpenSearch Service (successor to Amazon Elasticsearch Service). AWS AppSync added support for HTTP data sources in May 2018, which makes it easy to add legacy APIs to your GraphQL endpoints."
