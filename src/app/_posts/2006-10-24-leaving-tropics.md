If you caught yesterday's post, you probably heard about the less than ideal weather we had for sitting on the beach in Palm Cove yesterday. Well, we managed to squeeze in about an hour and a half of sitting on the beach before the rain clouds moved in. Unfortunately, the poor weather continued throughout most of the day, but that gave Zach and I an opportunity to relax and do some laundry so that we have clean clothes for the rest of the trip. We concluded our day with dinner at the Palm Cove Tavern.  
  
One thing we have noticed in our time here is that there is no real concept of a quick/to-go meal (with the exception of McDonalds and KFC). Most restaurants serve sit down meals (although at many you order at the counter before your food is brought to your table). Accordingly, food prices are also higher than we are used to in the US.  
  
In just a few hours we will be leaving the state of Queensland and heading south to Sydney in New South Wales. We already have a plethora of activities planned for Sydney, including a visit to the Opera House, Bondi Beach, the BrigeClimb, and a trip to the zoo for a much anticipated viewing of a _live_ kangaroo.
