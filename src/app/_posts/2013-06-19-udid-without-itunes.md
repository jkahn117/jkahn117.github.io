Quick Tip:

It's possible to find the UDID of an iOS device without iTunes (with the device plugged in to your Mac):

*   Launch "System Information" via Spotlight"
*   Select "USB" from the Hardware section on the left
*   Expand the various sections to find the device and select it
*   In the bottom panel, the "Serial Number" value is the UDID
