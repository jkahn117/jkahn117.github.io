title: "How to build a real-time sales analytics dashboard with Amazon ElastiCache for Redis"
author: "Josh"
summary: "Most often, when we discuss Amazon ElastiCache, it is in the context of enhancing the performance of read-heavy database workloads. We update our applications to employ a read-through or write-through pattern to keep data in the cache fresh and ease the burden on the database. When used in this context, ElastiCache accelerates your high volume workloads by caching your data in memory, delivering sub-millisecond data retrieval performance. Additionally, Amazon ElastiCache for Redis improves the availability and fault tolerance of your workload via automatic failover in Multi-AZ configurations."
